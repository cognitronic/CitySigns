          <h3>Step 1: Quote Request & Survey</h3>
      <p>At City Signs, we do our best to make the process of designing and building your custom signs as easy, convenient, and enjoyable as possible. The process starts with a quote request . Our sales team will respond by asking you a number of questions to understand what type of custom sign will best suit your needs and your budget. For local companies we will often times also visit your location to take measurements and photographs. It is also a great opportunity for us to introduce ourselves and continue the process of determining the best type of custom sign to meet your needs.</p>
            <h3>Step 2: Artwork & Design</h3>
      <p>Once we have a clear idea of your needs we will ask for any existing artwork you may have. We work with a broad array of artwork formats, including everything from hand-drawn sketches to vectorized files that you email to us. The most efficient (and therefore most cost-effective) format is vectorized artwork, in an .cdr, .pdf, .eps, or .ai format. Please ensure that all text is converted to outlines. If you are not able to convert text to outlines, check with us to see whether you’re using one of the thousands of fonts we have on file. If vector art is not available, we can nearly always scan and digitize your logo for a minimal charge. The most efficient way of sending your artwork to us is in a digital format, such as email, CD-ROM or DVD. If you do not have pre-existing artwork one of our talented graphic designers will be happy to take you through a logo design process, which is of course an additional charge in the creation of your sign. Typically the process to this point takes about two days.</p>
                   <h3>Step 3: Proof & Quote</h3>
      <p>When we have all of your information compiled our design team will produce a layout, showing the proposed signage superimposed on a photo of your location, if applicable. This proof, along with a quote from our sales team, will be sent via email. The proof will be a detailed layout of the proposed sign and should be reviewed very carefully to ensure your needs are being met. Through this process of emailing proofs we are able to make changes if necessary. Once you have reviewed your proof and are happy with the custom signage we’ve proposed, we will need a signed copy of the proof faxed or emailed to us. We also kindly ask for a 50% deposit, either check or credit card, in order to process your order.</p>
                  <h3>Step 4: Production & Installation, Delivery, or Pick-up</h3>
      <p>Once your signs have been completed, we can install them, ship them to you or you can pick them up at our office if your business is located in our area.</p>
